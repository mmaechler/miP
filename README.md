# miP - Multiple Imputation R package - using and comparing mainstream CRAN packages `mice`, `mi`, `Amelia`, ..

This originated as result of Paul Brix' master thesis with Anthony Unwin in Augsburg. 
One goal is to be able to use the mainstream and widely used CRAN packages for missing value data analysis,
notably applying **M**ultiple **I**mputation.

Currently, results from `mice`, `mi`, and `Amelia`  are (partly) supported.
