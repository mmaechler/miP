Description: Plots to visualize missing data and datasets that were
        produced by Multiple Imputation. The idea behind this package
        is to visualize MI objects produced by the R packages mi, mice
        or Amelia II to provide a better understanding of the imputed
        data and to evaluate the MI process.
VersionNote: This has been *archived* on CRAN;
	     X-CRAN-Comment: Archived on 2015-03-18 at the request of the maintainer.
  One main problem: 'mi' has changed much, e.g. uses
  missing_data.frame() instead of mi.data.frame() and exports much less in general
