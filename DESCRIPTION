Description: Plots to visualize missing data and datasets that were
        produced by Multiple Imputation. The idea behind this package
        is to visualize MI objects produced by the R packages mi, mice
        or Amelia II to provide a better understanding of the imputed
        data and to evaluate the MI process.
